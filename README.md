# Kast

C++20 game engine for building MMORPGs. `engine/` is the reusable runtime (SDL3 window + bgfx Direct3D 11);
`editor/` is the Unity-style editor (`kast_editor`) built on it with Dear ImGui docking.

## Prerequisites (Windows)

- Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ workload (MSVC v143)
- CMake 3.25+ and Ninja on `PATH`
- vcpkg checkout with `VCPKG_ROOT` set (e.g. `C:/vcpkg`)

Dependencies (`sdl3`, `bgfx`, `imgui[docking-experimental,sdl3-binding]`) install automatically from `vcpkg.json`
on first configure. The first configure builds bgfx's shader tools (glslang, SPIRV-Tools, ...) and takes several minutes.

`CMakePresets.json` sets `VCPKG_VISUAL_STUDIO_PATH` to `C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Community`
so vcpkg builds ports with VS 2022 even when newer Visual Studio versions are installed. Edit it if VS 2022 lives elsewhere.

## Quick start

```bat
build.bat              :: configure + build (debug). build.bat release for optimized
run.bat                :: run build\debug\kast_editor.exe from the repo root
run.bat release --size 1600x900   :: optional preset, then any editor flags
```

Both work from any terminal (cmd, PowerShell, VS Code; in PowerShell type `.\build.bat` / `.\run.bat`); `build.bat` sets up the VS 2022 environment and
`VCPKG_ROOT=C:/vcpkg` itself. Running from the repo root means the layout file is `imgui.ini` there.

## Build (manual)

Ninja needs VS 2022's `cl` on `PATH`. Get a VS 2022 x64 build environment one of these ways:

- **Start menu:** type `x64 Native Tools` and pick **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022**
  (not the VS 2026 one if that is installed too).
- **Any `cmd` window:**
  `"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"`
- **From PowerShell:** opens a `cmd` shell with the environment loaded:
  `cmd /k '"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"'`

That environment points `VCPKG_ROOT` at Visual Studio's bundled vcpkg, so reset it, then check both:

```bat
set VCPKG_ROOT=C:/vcpkg
where cl
echo %VCPKG_ROOT%
```

The first `cl` listed should be `...\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\<version>\bin\Hostx64\x64\cl.exe`, and
`VCPKG_ROOT` should print `C:/vcpkg`. Then build and test:

```bat
cd /d C:\dev\kast

cmake --preset debug
cmake --build --preset debug
ctest --preset debug

cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
ctest --preset release
```

Output goes to `build/<preset>/`; runtime DLLs are copied next to `kast_editor.exe`.

## Run

```bat
build\release\kast_editor.exe
```

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--frames N` | Run N frames, then quit cleanly (exit 0). |
| `--screenshot <path.png>` | With `--frames`: capture the backbuffer after frame N, write a PNG, then exit. Exit 1 if it can't be written. |
| `--size WxH` | Initial window size (default `1280x720`). |

Invalid arguments exit with code 2; init failures (SDL, window, bgfx) log the reason, show a message box, and exit 1.

The dock layout is saved to `imgui.ini` in the working directory; delete it to get the default layout back.

## Tests

`ctest` runs `editor_smoke`: `kast_editor --frames 120 --screenshot build/<preset>/smoke.png`, passing only if the
exit code is 0 and the PNG exists and is non-empty. It opens a real window for ~2 seconds.

## Shaders

The ImGui renderer's shaders (`editor/shaders/*.sc`) are compiled at build time to Direct3D 11 bytecode headers
(`-p s_5_0`) with `shaderc` from vcpkg's `bgfx[tools]` (a host dependency in `vcpkg.json`). Sources stay editable and
always match the installed bgfx version.

## Layout

```
engine/   log (stdout + in-memory lines), app (SDL3 window, bgfx init, main loop, resize, shutdown)
editor/   main.cpp (panels, dock layout, CLI), imgui_bgfx (ImGui renderer for bgfx), shaders/
cmake/    smoke_test.cmake
```
