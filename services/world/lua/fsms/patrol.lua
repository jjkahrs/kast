-- Sample NPC machine, given to the patrolling NPCs by their definitions (npcs/guard.lua, npcs/sentry.lua) and driven by
-- lua/systems/npcs.lua: walking <-> waiting. Each state may only be entered from the other one. The system does the
-- moving; the machine only says which phase the NPC is in, so another system (or a later quest step) can ask
-- kast.fsm.state(npc) instead of keeping its own flag.
--
-- Bandwidth: no callbacks, so a transition sends nothing.
