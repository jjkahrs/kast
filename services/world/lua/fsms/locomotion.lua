-- Sample character machine, attached by lua/systems/locomotion.lua: idle <-> moving. Each state may only be entered
-- from the other one, so idle -> idle (or moving -> moving) is denied. Every enter tells the owner's client
-- "fsm.state" {machine, from, to} (from is absent on the first entry), so clients and kast_bot can observe it.

-- Bandwidth: one message to the owner per transition, never per tick.
