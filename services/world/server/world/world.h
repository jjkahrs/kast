// The world: one MapContext per loaded world map (maps.h), each with its own registry, AOI grid, Lua systems, NPC spawns
// and tile activation, created the first time a map is used (START_MAP's when the scripts load), one per live copy of
// an instance map (docs/services/world/instances.html: made on entry, by instance key, destroyed once empty for the
// map's emptyTimeoutSec), plus the realm context, whose Lua state runs only the game state machines. Each tick updates the map contexts in steps, with a serial point
// between the steps where the work the contexts queued for one another is done (docs/services/world/maps.html#map-contexts).
// With rules.mapThreads > 1 the contexts of a step update at once on that many workers, with a barrier after each step;
// they share nothing mutable meanwhile, so the result is the serial one (docs/services/world/maps.html#threading).
// Talks to the outside only through Send (to a session), SendMany (one message to several) and Save (to the DB
// worker), always on the calling thread. Each player and NPC is on one map (MapRef), in that map's context; only
// transfer() changes it. Entity ids are process-wide (Shared, IdPool), so the ids on the wire and in Lua stay unique
// and stable across contexts.
