// The only threads that talk to MySQL: a pool of DB_POOL_SIZE workers, each with its own connection. The game thread
// enqueues work; results come back through `post` (asio::post onto the io_context), so the tick never blocks on the
// database.
//
// Saves are not ordinary jobs: they go into a pending map keyed by character (latest position wins) and are
// retried with exponential backoff until they land. A pending save is never dropped, and a character is never
// loaded while its save is still pending. Both hold because a character belongs to one worker (charId % pool size):
// its saves and its EnterWorld load run there, in order. Lobby jobs (list/create/delete) go to any idle worker.
